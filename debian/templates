_Description: Definitions in /etc/dailystrips.defs override packaged definitions
 You have an /etc/dailystrips.defs file installed.  Be warned that entries
 in there will override those in the packaged strips.def file, so if you
 created that file because it was more up-to-date than the packaged entry,
 it would be a good idea to check it against the packaged one (in
 /usr/share/dailystrips/strips.defs) and remove the one in /etc now
 (assuming that the new one contains the same fixes yours does).
 .
 Check the README.debian for more details.
