dailystrips (1.0.28-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Neutered dailystrips-update and updated documentation.  As
    dailystrips-update will be removed from a future version of this
    package, anyone who has it invoked automatically (e.g., through a cron
    job) should remove that now.  Closes: #553308
  * Added Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal (smbc).  Closes: #535831
  * Changed Dorktower definition.  Closes: #540537

dailystrips (1.0.28-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix for comics apparently migrated to gocomics from ucomics over the
    past few days (using a new class definition gocomics-srch):
    calvinandhobbes, tomthedancingbug, thefifthwave, bensargent,
    patoliphant.
  * Cleanup of strips.def, thanks to suggestions by Sebastian Rasmussen.
    This affects the following strips: sinfest, theweedpatch, bruno, angst,
    crfh, adventurers, fuzzylogic, mrchuckshow, pentasmal, elflifeadult,
    funnyfarm, elflife, wandering, cutewendy, bigones, brainbuzz, swamp,
    thenorm, melonpool, weakendwarriors, nekobox, stockcartoons, thatsjake,
    agnes, archie, askshagg, ballardstreet, bachelorparty, charlie,
    flightdeck, flofriends, forheavenssake, heathcliff, herbandjamaal,
    libertymeadows, momma, mrhousewife, jimmymargulies, queenofwands,
    nothingnice, instantclassic, halge, elvis, pondus, thismodernworld,
    apartment3g, babsandaldo, kernelpanic, statsministeren, antiherohire,
    kaerwyn, vgcats, suburbanjungle, wulffmorgenthaler, orderofthestick,
    gucomics, bunny, blacktapsdonate, drfun, fans, machall.  Some have been
    retired, some modified, and some brought back from the dead.  I have
    only verified that for a trivial run, the existing strips that work on
    the day that I tested are still working.  Closes: #508638
  * Added link to the dailystrips homepage (though it seems to be abandoned
    by upstream) to debian/control.

dailystrips (1.0.28-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Permit any non-whitespace characters in strip definitions (necessary for
    the new definitions.)
  * Fixes for Unitedmedia strips, will cause breakage for people using strips
    that have been renamed/are missing -- dailystrips will issue warnings and
    errors in this case.  Closes: #504999, #504574
  * Above fixes resulted in renames for many comics, including those that used
    to be called: alleyoop, arlonjanis, bignate, bornloser, buckets, chickweed,
    franknernest, geech, getfuzzy, grandave, grizzwells, hedge, janesworld,
    jumpstart, kitncarlyle, raisingduncan, reality, ripleys, roseisrose,
    shirleynson, soup2nutz, tarzan, workingdaze.
  * A number of old Unitemedia strips seem to be gone.  If you care about them
    and find them elsewhere, patches are accepted.  These include:
    bullsnbears, gingermeggs, lupo, meatloaf, pibgorn, potluck, stockcartoons.
  * Some new strips thanks to Friedrich Delgado Friedrichs.  This fixes
    sexylosers, perscheid, clanofthecats, btaf, touche, haiopeis, and adds
    orderofthestick, sharingauniverse, girlgenius, afterlifeblues,
    gruftschlampe, promis, taztouche.  Closes: #504633
  * New definitions for sexylosers, btaf, and orderofthestick (new strip)
    require that curl be installed, and mean that those URLs will be fetched
    on every invocation of dailystrips (whether you are using them or not).
    Thus, these entries are commented in the strips.def for you to uncomment
    or put in your personal ~/.dailystrips.defs file.
  * Hagar appears to be working (again?).  Closes: #265450

  * Fixed strips definition for Bob, The Angry Flower.
  * Fixed minus/hyphen problems in dailystrips-clean and dailystrips-update
    man pages.

dailystrips (1.0.23-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (note: supplied by upstream slightly in advance of
    the actual release)
  * Modified upstream code to explicitly include 5.005 libraries to
    accomodate people with older versions of modules installed (since
    perl-5.6.1-7 removed that entry in @INC).  This hack will be removed
    post-woody.  (Closes: #143711, #143805)
  * Modified upstream code to specify "perl -S" when calling
    dailystrips-clean.  (Closes: #143804)
  * Urgency medium because #143711 is vaguely a dependency bug and
    dependencies are an important bug so I'd like this to get some "testing"
    testing before we release.

  * Initial Release. (Closes: #105243)

    corrected an apparent editing mistake in dailystrips.pl, and installed
    binary as "dailystrips" instead of "dailystrips.pl".
  * Wrote a simple manpage.
